<!-- ABOUT -->
<section id="about" class="section fade-in">
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I am a 4th-year Integrated MSc Data Science student at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham
    with strong academic grounding and hands-on experience in machine learning,
    data analysis, and research-oriented problem solving.
  </p>
  <p>
    My interests lie at the intersection of Machine Learning, Healthcare AI, and
    data-driven decision systems. I enjoy working on end-to-end ML pipelines —
    from data preprocessing and exploratory analysis to model building,
    evaluation, and interpretation.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am particularly inclined towards research, explainable AI, and applying
    ML solutions to real-world societal and healthcare challenges.
